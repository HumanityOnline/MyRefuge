Sholi Loewenthal
CEO
MyRefuge.World

MyRefuge.World is working in partnership with NACCOM and other NGOs to develop a 'one-stop-shop' technology to help refugees integrate into hosting communities. The goal is to bring together communities around the world to help refugees out of refugee camps and into communities where they can build a future. We are currently piloting a small scale UK collaboration around accommodation and building features into MyRefuge to enable other provisions - including social, employment, education etc - to be offered and found via the platform.
